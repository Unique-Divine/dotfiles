# Reusable command to create pull request description

Please write a clear, logical, and concise pull request description for my diffs
agaist main @Branch (Diff with Main Branch) . 

Don't be repetitive, and explain rationale as best you can. But keep things
clear, clear, clear.

The formatting should include:
- An h1 title with synopsis text beneath the title
- h2 section for "Key Changes". 
- (Optional) Everything else can go in a separate h2 called "Appendix".

Save the output to a markdown file called "pull-request.md"
